            You're having lunch with your friend Victoria and she spend the afternoon gushing on about her new partner. After nearly an hour of you showing clear distaste for the conversation, she offers to set you up with a co-worker of hers. You're reluctant at first due to months of unsuccessful dating, but after some convincing, you decide to give it a shot. 
            <br> What do you have to loose? <br> <br> <br>
