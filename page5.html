        <h3 style="color:black; background-color:white"> The thought of this non-linear, or I guess multilinear story where you start to make sense of thestory by play more is really interesting. This "netfilm"as Olia likes to call it is a unique spin on a traditional interactive narrative, now we see hypertext as a narrative form all the time. Throughvery little time it can feel like you're apart of this very intimate incounter where dialog stacks to form a complex relationship. <br>-Anna </h3>

        <h3 style="color:black; background-color:white">I thought that the art piece gave off an eerie feel in the way it used only black and white as well as silhouettes of men and objects. There wasn't a direct storyline, so I thought giving the audience a chance to interact with the piece was very unique so that eveyone can have an individualized experience with the art. When I began interacting with the piece, I was a little confused because I never interacted with something like this before but I found the experience suspenseful because I wasn't sure what would be after each click.<br>-Natalie </h3>
