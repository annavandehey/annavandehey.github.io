				As We May Think
			</h3>
			<p>
				This article dove into the history of science and improving communication before the internet and web we know today. Inventions like the typewriter, camera, or train were all inventions that are still developing in order to bring us closer to one another. Something that I found interesting and ironic is that in current times, while scientist's for generations have devoted their careers to bettering our networks for communication, the internet, while one of the most paramount accomplishments for human communication, also provides a significant amount of misimformation about science. While the article poses the "manipulation of ideas" as a good thing (which it certainly can be) in recent months, I have only been thinking of the downsides freespeach and overall freedom can have on public health and public policy.

				Long Live the Web
			</h3>
			<p>
				I thought the statement we should think of the web as some sort of piece of nature was an interesting concept that I had never thought about before. Just like concepts with climate change, the internet is forever changing and without cognitive change, because of the extreme effects the internet has on our lives, the effects could have an impact on society for generations. While the openness of the web is ceratinly a good thing on paper for democracy's sake, web privacy is something we need to prioritize heading into the future. The web has been a great tool for humanity as a whole, but the way coportations use the web to grow their markets to oligopolistic standards should be a frontal concern for our generation.
