    <div class="slide3"><p id="slide3">
        Part 1: <br>
      - Access and transmission of medium, works, and art <br>
      - Concepts of copies versus originals <br>
      - Manipulation of communication based on how <br>
      we interpret visual information

    <div class="slide3"><p id="slide3"> 
      Part 2: <br>
      - Realtionship between viewing and objectifcation <br>
      of women <br>
      - "A women's image of herself is derived from a<br> 
      man's ideal view of her" <br>
      - Gender expectations in art <br>

        <div class="text">I related this section to an artist I studied named Yasumasa Morimura. He is a Japanese artist that creates self-portraits of him recreating iconic works. In this image, he imposes himself on an overly sexualized woman to challenge the overt sexualization of women in media and art. </div>

        <div class="text">This section reminded me particularly of the aestics behind the 50's and consumer culture. While today it has taken a different form through social media and influencers, classic magazines and print media were beyond influential in pursuading people of a need for products. I think back to advancements like the dishwasher and how they were able to represent a status through advertisments connecting to our value system.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="slide3"><p id="slide3">
      Part 3 & 4: <br>
      - Paintings as a celebrated private possession <br>
      to convey wealth <br>
      - Consumerist society revolving around art <br> 
      and advertisements <br>
      - Envy culture <br>
