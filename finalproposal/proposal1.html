      <div style="color:white; align-items: center; margin: 2cm;">I want to create another game/interactive narrative. I am very interested in game design and I think it would be a helpful addition to my portfolio. I hope to make this project less linear than I had in the past through java script and keeping track of mulitple variables and want to show off some CSS animation for my characters. I also plan on illistrating (and potentially animating other images) the game myself to develop some of my skills in that direction as well.</div></text>
