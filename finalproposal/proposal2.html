        <div class="text">"A stalemate ensues as a webbed, winged patroon politely refrains from picking a menu order while reminding various wait staff members to supply his table with free, fresh leavened bread. After a manager attempts to broker peace by offering slices at steeply-discounted prices, the unfed mallard storms from the establishment in waddled disgust, grumbly wondering why anything in this world worth having comes with a bill attached." -Joey Allgood </div>

        A piece inspired by Joey Allgood: <br>
      - HUNGRY DUCK CONTINUES WAITING FOR COMPLIMENTARY BREAD BASKET <br>
      - Cute, fun illistrations with "darker" stories that are funny and relatable. <br>
      - Apply this style to my game to create a funny piece where the writing matters. <br>

        PIGEON HOMESICK IN JERSEY: <br>

      - Use of puns <br>

        <div class="text"> "After accepting a competitive corporate position in a neighboring state, a native New York bird spends every evening pining for its old life back home. With the familiar skyline nestled just above the horizon, the restless rock dove is suddenly seized by a compulsion to take flight, before burying that angst in yet another all-nighter." -Joey Allgood </div>

        <div class="text">"Vehicles come to a standstill as seven penguins bop into one another on a major highway. As the birds have a grand time playing in tiny cars, motorists struggle to convince skeptical employers why they will be late for work." -Joey Allgood</div>

    PENGUINS IN BUMPER CARS CAUSE MASSIVE TRAFFIC JAM: <br>
